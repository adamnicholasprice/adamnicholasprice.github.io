I am a computational hydrologist and Climate Adaptation Postdoctoral Fellow with the
Northwest Climate Adaptation Science Center at the University of Washington and Boise State University.

My research seeks to explain hydrological phenomena through the use of analytical mathematics, numerical simulation, statistical inference, and machine learning methods and is at the intersection coproduction of science around these issues.
